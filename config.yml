# GIF-speed:
#    1 means it will run at the fps specified after "fps:"
#    0.5 means half speed. Most GIFs run best with half speed and "fps:" at 20, resulting in 10 fps.
#    Also, this step of the config is really not that configurable.
#    The only values resulting in any change is from 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625 and so on.
# FPS:
#    Max FPS is 20 so if you enter anything more than 20 it will still be fixed at 20.
#    If anything lower than 1 is entered the fps will be fixed at 1.

fps: 20
gif-speed: 0.5
